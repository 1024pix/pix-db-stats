# Documentation:
# - Overview: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/
# - Caching: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/
#
# Things to know:
# - every job is a container
# - cache is used for data that can potentially be reused between builds, provided we can
#   be sure it will not influence the build result other than by speeding it up.
# - cache is immutable. Sometimes we need to flush the cache, but we can't. That's why there is this
#   `v1-` at the beginning. Increment it when you need to change the cache content.
# - because we use `npm ci`, we cache the `~/.npm` directory and not `node_modules` which
#   is erased by `npm ci`.
# - to make sure the cache is indexed by the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files,
#   we concatenate them into a temporary file whose checksum we use as part of the cache key.
# - for data that is specific to a build (commit), like the source code downloaded from github,
#   we use Circle CI's workspace feature to transport it between jobs.
